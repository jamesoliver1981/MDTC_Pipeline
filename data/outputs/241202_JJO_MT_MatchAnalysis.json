                "There are only 18 rally points.  Rally insights could be volatile.\n\nYour Rally Effectiveness Score is 47.  This is 1pts better than average.\nEffectiveness is calculated on outcomes per shot. If the shot continues to rally, the score is given an extra +1.\n\nYour Win Balance is +11%.  This is 9pts better than average.\nWin Balance compares the points played in rally and subtracts the lost points from the won points and divides by Rally points played.\n\nOf the 57 shots played, 53% were Forehands, 33% were Backhands, 12% were Slice, 2% were Volleys, and 0% were Overheads.\nNote shot distributions and shot effectiveness are for ALL shots, NOT just the rallies.  The only shots excluded are the Serve & Return.  The +1 shots are included in the below.\n\nEffectiveness for each shot is defined differently as each shot typically has different aims.  Also be careful about over-interpretating the data if the number of shots is small.\n\nBased on 30 shots, the Forehand Effectiveness Score is 43, which is Medium but on the Low end.  This is because you are only winning marginally more points than you lose on your Forehand.\n\nBased on 19 shots, the Backhand Effectiveness Score is 61, which is Medium and on the High end.  You have a positive Win Balance of + 5pts.\n\nBased on 7 shots, the Slice Effectiveness Score is 67, which is High.  Your Slice is a wepoan and have a clear Win Balance of + 14pts.\n\n",

Note this highlights that serve and return points are the key focus areas. Review this section in your Personal Summary to understand the general trends in your rally game.\n\nShot Mix & Effectiveness is based on 57 shots.  Note where frequencies are low, data can be volatile.\n\nYou play slightly more Forehands than Backhand & Slice combined, however the effectiveness of your Forehand is NOT good. Forehand should be the sword with which you win points. Look to see how you can create more pressure with this.\n"
